<h1>Calculate crossing point of two straight lines or line segments.</h1>
<p>
You can draw two line segments on a plane bounded by a rectangle and
calculate the coordinate of their intersection point.
</p>
<h2>1. Drawing the line segments on a plane.</h2>
<p>
On device without a touch screen, use the mouse cursor to indicate the starting point of
the line segment and press the left mouse button, also indicate the end point.
On touch screen devices, touch the start and end points for each line segment.
</p>
<h2>2. Coordinates of start and end points.</h2>
<p>
The coordinates (only positive values) of the mouse cursor or screen finger touch coordinate
are defined in the global coordinate system.
The origin of the coordinates (0,0) is located in the upper left corner of the rectangle bounding the plane.
The x-axis is directed from top to bottom, the y-axis is from left to right.
For each line segment, absolute coordinates and Cartesian coordinates are determined.
The origin (0,0) of the Cartesian coordinate system is at the center of the rectangle bounding the plane.
</p>
<h2>3. Transforming the line segments to a straight line.</h2>
After two line segments are drawn, radio buttons appear: "LINE SEGMENT" and "LINE".
If you check the "LINE" button, then the line segment will be transformed into a straight line passing
through two given points until it intersects with a rectangle bounding the plane.
</p>
<h2>4. Calculation of the coordinates of the intersection point.</h2>
To calculate the intersection point, click the "Calculate with JS"  or "Calculate with PHP" button.
If the "Calculate with PHP" button is pressed, AJAX-Request will be sent to the server
and AJAX-Response" will be received.
